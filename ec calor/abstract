The use of Machine Learning (ML) is spreading across many fields, showing good performance in various tasks. ML has not been widely used in the mathematical field, but some evidence of it's potential has been published. This paper proposes a way of approximating a Partial Derivative Equation (PDE) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on keras and tensorflow that is capable of running on a conventional laptop. We analyze its performance against a very well known PDE, the heat equation with dirichlet conditions for a non derivable nor continuous initial function. We tried the use of different families of functions as training datasets aswell as different time spreadings seeking better performance.
