The use of Machine Learning (ML) is spreading across many fields, showing good performance in various tasks. ML has not been widely used in the mathematical field, but some evidence of it's potential has been published. This paper proposes a way of approximating a Partial Derivative Equation (PDE) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that is capable of running on a conventional laptop. We analyze it's performance against a very well known PDE, the heat equation with dirichlet conditions for a non derivable nor continuous initial function. Also we explore different training data and techniques.
